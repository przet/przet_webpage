At time of writing (Sept 2018), I have been working professionally as a software engineer for 2 years. My educational background was in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical (i.e theoretical) Statistics. I have definitely always been a programmer at heart. I grew up on the IBM PS/2 running Windows 3.1 and always enjoyed hacking around behind the scenes trying to get things (mainly games) to work. This continued throughout my teenage years to early twenties (using the latest OSes at the time, not just 3.1!). During my studies at uni, I drifted more towards understanding the fundamentals of mathematics and physics than computing.
