<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>I am a software engineer from Adelaide, Australia. I love building things
 through code, and understanding the machine underneath.</p>

<h2> Links to some of my work </h2>
<p> Most of my work is available on my github:</p>
<a href=https://github.com/przet>My Github</a>
<p> I also have a registered business "Obsession Games":</p>
<a href=https://github.com/obsessiongames>Obsession Games</a>
<p> It's in its infancy at the moment, with effort going into prototyping, and learning/playing around. <p>

<h2> My Articles </h2>
<p> I like writing about things. Here is a collection (ever-growing while I populate it/write more) of my writings.</p>

<p> I don't have comments enabled yet, but if you wish for some discourse, please contact me by email:</p>
<p> p.rzetelski.note@gmail.com </p>

<ul>
    <li> Empty List. This means I still have to populate this. </li>
