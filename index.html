<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>I am a software engineer from Adelaide, Australia. I love building things
 through code, and understanding the machine underneath.</p>

<h2> Links to some of my work </h2>
<p> Most of my work is available on my github:</p>
<a href=https://github.com/przet>My Github</a>
<p> I also have a registered business "Obsession Games":</p>
<a href=https://github.com/obsessiongames>Obsession Games</a>
<p> It's in its infancy at the moment, with effort going into prototyping, and learning/playing around <p>
