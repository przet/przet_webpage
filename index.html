<h2><a id="whoami"></a> Who am I? </h2>
<p>I am a software engineer from Adelaide, Australia. I love building things, and solving problems,
through code.<br> I like to understand programming and computing from the lowest level, even when coding at higher levels.
</p>

<h2><a id="whyisthiswebsitesosimple"></a> Why is this website so simple? </h2>
<p> I like flashy and beautiful websites, but it didn't feel right to me to not be in control of the code of my own website. <br>
I wanted to write it from scratch, and understand everything I did, something that frameworks would take away from me.</p>

<p> I also wanted the focus to be mainly on my code and output.
</p>

<h2><a id="linkswork"></a> Links to some of my work </h2>
<p> Most of my work is available on my github:</p>
<a href=https://github.com/przet>My Github</a>
<p> I also have a registered business name "Obsession Games": </p>
<a href=https://github.com/obsessiongames>Obsession Games</a>
<p>I like the field of computer graphics and game development and decided to register a business name for two reasons: cool factor, and also as a motivator for focus and selectivity (as there are so many things in software to do!)<p>
<p> It's in its infancy at the moment, with effort going into prototyping, and learning/playing around. </p>

<h2><a id="articles"></a> My Writings </h2>
<p> I like writing about things. Here is a collection (ever-growing while I populate it/write more) of my writings.</p>

<p> I don't have comments enabled yet, but if you wish for some discourse, please contact me by email:</p>
<p> p.rzetelski.note@gmail.com </p>

<ul>
    <li> Empty List. This means it is still being populated, or my articles are not yet ready to be released to the wild. </li>
